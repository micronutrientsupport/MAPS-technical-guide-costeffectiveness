# MAPS cost effectiveness models

## The scope of this guide

This guide is aimed at anyone looking to understand the cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness modelling of micronutrient interventions available in the MAPS tool as part of the learning activity.

The MAPS tool has been developed to meet the previously unmet needs of users for an “easy to use” system that does not require extensive training.

## Accessing the MAPS tool

The MAPS tool can be accessed directly from <https://maps.micronutrient.support/> or <https://maps.micronutrient.support/maps-tool>, and via our shortcut <https://www.maps.africa/>. All three links lead to exactly the same version of the tool.

The MAPS tool has been optimised for screen sizes typically found with desktop and laptop devices, rather than smaller mobile devices. Using smaller devices is possible, but will not provide the intended user experience of the interfaces, particularly for the cost-effectiveness module. The tool will work in widely used commercial operating systems and web browsers (as at 2024).

Access is free of charge and does not require users to log-in. Users of the full scope of functionality, i.e. the cost & effectiveness modelling, and/or bring-your-own data, may prefer to create a user account in order to save for a later date their own input data and models.

The current version of the tool is \<![](images/WiP_purplespanner.svg)\>, and **returning users** may need to check a locally cached earlier version is not being used. If this is the case, follow your browser instructions to clear the cache and refresh your version of the MAPS tool.
